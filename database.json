      "articleContent": "Tennessee homes continued to sell at eye-popping prices last month. The median home sale price rose 5.4% year-over-year from $345,700 to $364,700 in January. The number of homes sold on the market declined by 1.6% YoY from 4,962 to ~4,881 homes, with only 4 months of supply. Does the scarcity of houses make Tennessee a seller’s market? Let’s look at the facts. Nashville homes sold for a median sale price of $440,000 in January, up 5.0% year-over-year. Homes in Knoxville sold for a median sale price of $327,000, a 20.2% increase year-over-year. In fact, there were no markets in Tennessee where prices declined year-over-year.",
